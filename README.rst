Parse and Query Genomic File Formats

Description
===========
EFS parser provides parsers and utility methods to read and query commonly used genomic file formats. 
The results of the query are transformed into a Pandas DataFrame. This allows users to take 
advantage of many of the visual and analysis packages in the pandas/numpy ecosystem.
